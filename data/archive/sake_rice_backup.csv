Gohyakumangoku,Niigata,Kikusui x Shin no 200,1938,"The second most cultivated sakamai. Produces clean, crisp, and light sake with a simple, refreshing profile. Developed in 1938 by crassing Kikusui (an ancestor of Omachi) and Shin No. 200 (an ancestor of Kame no O). its name comes from a bumper crop of the rice in 1957 that yelded 5 million koku, or Gohyakumangoku. It was developed for Niigata's cold climate whore sake rice has to be cold resistant and grow in a relatively short growing season. The nice is easy to make koji with and lends itself well to the Echigo toji's tsuki haze köil, creating a sharp, crisp, light, and very clean sake.
