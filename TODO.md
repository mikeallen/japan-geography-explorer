# Japan Geography Explorer TODO list

This is list of things that still need to be done to improve the app.

Fix minor japanese localization issues (there are still a few places where english shows up when it shouldn't)

Use the geodata for the rivers to identify which other prefectures they are also present in and extend the data set to reflect this. Only add an additional prefecture for a river if at least 10% of the river is in it. For example, the Kitakami river shows Akita as its prefecture, but it is also in Fukushima, so the list should add fukushima as a second prefecture for it. The Abukuma river is another example. The visualization should also reflect this new data.  

The old provinces tab still has bad data, and the visualization still shows borders that should not be there (eg dewa should encompass the combination of the areas of akita and yamagata and there should be no visible border between where those two lie. Look for new sources of geo data to power this map. Use data which corresponds to the late Edo period.
